# Kinetostatic_Robot_Calculation
Created as final project for the course "Machine Design Process" by Professor Jingshan Zhao. Part of the engineering double degree master program at Tsinghua University.
Calculation of Kinetostatics of a simplificated robotic system in 2D (like a robotic arm or finger).
Via a GUI the lengths and angles between the links of a robotic finger/arm can be entered as well as 2d load at the robots end.
The notebook plots the robotic configuration and calculates the torques and forces acting on the robotic joints via the force screw and veloctiy screw theory developed by Professor Jingshan Zhao.s
